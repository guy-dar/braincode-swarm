# Glossary retrieval for this item

Glossary 19.0.0-draft.2-lexical-groups+g19 (sha be5d8379f7a6). 22 needs (decomposition: llm), 175 glossary records retrieved.

Every need below must end up expressed in the translation, or listed as unresolved in the coverage table *after* widening the search (`node /kit/rag.mjs widen "<need text>"`). Candidates are ranked best first; `exact` means a symbol or alias phrase literally occurs in the need.

(* = exact name/alias match; → = the value group the need's noun/value belongs to)

## Value groups (all of them)

Leaf values are written `group::key` and have no glossary entry: any admissible key is valid (open groups: a lower-case word; country and currency: the ISO code, `country::JP`, `currency::ZAR`). Use a group only in a slot whose signature accepts `ATOM[group]`.

- `animal_label::<key>` — open label, lower_word — A source-supplied animal-kind label; denotes that labeled animal kind, without inferred taxonomy, behavior or capabilities. e.g. animal_label::cat, animal_label::tuna | slots: search_web.target, activity.object, lexical_label.value
- `color_label::<key>` — open label, lower_word — A source-supplied color-name qualifier; no numeric color coordinates, shade equivalence or color-space conversion is implied. e.g. color_label::red, color_label::blue | slots: search_web.color, pick_up.color, lexical_label.value
- `country::<key>` — ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (249), upper_code — A country identified by its ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (country::JP is Japan). The code names the country only; no language, currency or region membership is implied. e.g. country::JP, country::DE | slots: search_travel.location, search_transit.location, search_web.location, check_reservation_availability.location, activity.location, subject.location, weather_condition.location
- `currency::<key>` — ISO 4217 codes (178), upper_code — A currency identified by its ISO 4217 code (currency::ZAR is the South African rand); no exchange rate or implicit conversion. e.g. currency::USD, currency::EUR | slots: search_web.currency, check_reservation_availability.currency, measure.unit
- `food_label::<key>` — open label, lower_word — A source-supplied food-kind label; denotes that labeled food kind, without inferred ingredients, preparation, nutrition or biology. e.g. food_label::tomato, food_label::egg | slots: search_web.target, pick_up.target, activity.object, lexical_label.value
- `genre_label::<key>` — open label, lower_word — An explicitly supplied genre label, without inferred genre taxonomy. e.g. genre_label::comedy, genre_label::shoegaze | slots: search_web.genre, lexical_label.value
- `object_label::<key>` — open label, lower_word — An explicitly supplied label of an object kind; no inferred physical properties or English sense. e.g. object_label::thimble, object_label::pillow | slots: search_web.target, pick_up.target, pick_up.source, place.destination, place.location, rinse.destination, heat.destination, chill.destination …
- `platform_label::<key>` — open label, lower_identifier — A source-supplied name of a software platform, service, framework, library, package, build tool or operating system (platform_label::django, platform_label::windows). Denotes that named system only; no version, vendor, capability or relation between systems is implied. e.g. platform_label::django, platform_label::windows, platform_label::pytorch_lightning | slots: modify_code.target, run_tests.target, requirement.value, activity.instrument, subject.qualifier, regression_case.framework, failure.system, attribute_claim.subject …

## Retrieved records

### Shared rules that govern the records below (full text)

**rule_lexical_groups** (v19/rule/lexical-groups; rule governing platform_label)

Section 3.1 defines value groups: `group::key` values of type ATOM[group]. Open groups admit any key of their form (examples are not whitelists); standard groups admit the codes of their bundled standard (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 for country, ISO 4217 for currency). Leaf values are never glossary entries. Consumer signatures alone decide where a group may appear. Retired bare symbols are invalid.

**rule_reading_guide** (v19/rule/reading-guide; core)

The spec governs syntax/types; this glossary defines vocabulary. Signature notation: ? optional, A / B explicit alternatives, void no result. Omitted optional arguments are unspecified. Value entries are category-refined STRING primitives; complex meanings require composition. Aliases are contextual hints, not unconditional equivalences. Report ambiguity. IDs use v19/<category>/<symbol>, v19/support/<symbol> or v19/composite/<symbol>. Statuses apply to this candidate: Retained preserves meaning; Adapted uses the stated contract; Composite requires TERM (bare STRING deprecated); Structural is syntax/argument vocabulary; Needs clarification is unusable until resolved; Deprecated is historical; Accepted is usable within this candidate.

**rule_recording_signatures** (v19/rule/recording-signatures; rule governing walk)

RECORD ACTION uses the operation signature with REF[STRING] → TERM and LIST[REF[STRING]] → LIST[TERM]; other types/categories stay unchanged. Return EVENT, never the runtime result. Record actual outputs as attributed CLAIMs. Do not infer missing resources.

**rule_speech_acts_general** (v19/rule/speech-acts-general; rule governing express_interest)

UTTER-only, void, with the spec's speech attributes and LIST[TERM] constraints. No result binding. Literal content cannot replace required semantic arguments for structured coverage.

**rule_structural_constructs** (v19/rule/structural-constructs; core)

Apply spec Sections 2–14 for modes, binding, control, calls, claims, records and canonical form. No extra syntax is introduced by documentation aliases types-lexicon/action/bind. Epistemic and recording statuses are reserved in their grammar positions. SOURCE and lower-case source are distinct; names are case-sensitive. Residual descriptive values cannot hide propositions.

**rule_trace_relations_general** (v19/rule/trace-relations-general; rule governing motivated_by)

Relations cover their published signatures only; recording a success differs from assuming it. No unlisted reasoning relation is implied.

**rule_attributes_and_generate** (v19/rule/attributes-and-generate; rule governing art_short_text)

Attribute entries name arguments; legality/types come from each operation, not global membership. GENERATE uses the spec's core fields; retained artifact profiles return STRING. Numeric/list results need explicit profiles. Legacy itinerary fields expand to TERM constraints: duration/duration_unit → duration(amount,unit); stop_min_per_day/stop_requirement → minimum_per_period(class,count,period=unit_day), never an inferred temple class; max_walk_duration/unit → maximum_between_stops(activity="walk",amount,unit). No legacy shorthand is enabled. Old events/character_properties/transformations become explicitly scoped TERM constraints. Message purpose is TERM, not send_email.content: GENERATE exact STRING content, then send. Report opaque fallback separately.

**rule_category_artifact_value** (v19/rule/category/artifact-value; rule governing art_social_post)

STRING artifact class for GENERATE.target. art_story says what kind of artifact to produce, not what occurs in its plot.

**rule_category_constraint_value** (v19/rule/category/constraint-value; rule governing constraint_exclude_flowery_language)

Existing requirements are TERM constructors, except unresolved entries explicitly marked. `constraints=[constraint_realistic]` is invalid; construct the TERM first.

**rule_category_duration_unit_value** (v19/rule/category/duration-unit-value; rule governing unit_sentence)

STRING units partitioned into temporal (second through year) and output counts (word/item/paragraph/character). Do not use unit_word as elapsed time. Months/years are calendar units, not fixed seconds.

**rule_category_entity_name** (v19/rule/category/entity-name; rule governing mittens)

STRING descriptors select kinds/resources. `mug` is a descriptor, not REF. Resource symbols may be used only when the source explicitly requests such a resource; missing equipment is not automatically inserted.

**rule_category_event_value** (v19/rule/category/event-value; rule governing event_sadie_adler_unmasking)

TERM-described narrative event, not a recorded EVENT. Require inclusion explicitly when generating a story.

**rule_category_locale_value** (v19/rule/category/locale-value; rule governing locale_en_us)

STRING locale. “English” alone does not always mean locale_en_us; preserve ambiguity.

**rule_category_location_name** (v19/rule/category/location-name; rule governing corner)

STRING location descriptor. A `table` surface is not the generated artifact category art_table.

**rule_category_product_attribute_value** (v19/rule/category/product-attribute-value; rule governing material_memory_foam)

STRING color/size/product-market facets. gender_women describes a product category, not an assertion about a person's gender.

**rule_category_recipient_value** (v19/rule/category/recipient-value; rule governing role_daughter)

STRING roles or explicit named recipients. A role is not an exact person's identity. Keep an explicit name where substituting a role loses information.

**rule_category_reservation_status_value** (v19/rule/category/reservation-status-value; rule governing reservation_unavailable)

STRING filter states; neither is a BOOL result binding. check_reservation_availability returns a BOOL with a distinct handle.

**rule_category_search_value** (v19/rule/category/search-value; rule governing rank_distance)

STRING refinements rank_ / dir_ / cat_ / avail_ / genre_ are separate. rank_rating may fill rank_field; genre_label::comedy may not. “Cheapest” usually requires both rank_price and dir_asc, not rank_price alone.

**rule_category_semantic_category_value** (v19/rule/category/semantic-category-value; rule governing class_town)

STRING class label used by typed constraints. class_temple describes a class, not an acquired physical temple reference.

**rule_category_shape_value** (v19/rule/category/shape-value; rule governing shape_square)

STRING geometry. shape_round may select a circular object; it does not imply color or dimensions.

**rule_category_spatial_relation** (v19/rule/category/spatial-relation; rule governing in_front_of)

STRING relation used by place. `in` and `on` have different spatial meaning and are not aliases. Orientation requires context when left/right/front are ambiguous.

**rule_category_state_value** (v19/rule/category/state-value; rule governing state_warm)

STRING condition used in selection. state_warm does not command heat; “hot” is not automatically synonymous with “warm.”

**rule_category_style_value** (v19/rule/category/style-value; rule governing style_catchy)

STRING production style. style_narrative does not establish that described events occurred.

**rule_category_tone_value** (v19/rule/category/tone-value; rule governing tone_silly)

STRING register. tone_urgent describes urgency, not a concrete deadline.

**rule_category_topic_value** (v19/rule/category/topic-value; rule governing topic_pickup_lines)

Named subjects remain STRING; complex compositional topics use the listed TERM constructors. A subject label does not encode the question or claim about it.

**rule_composites_general** (v19/rule/composites-general; rule governing constraint_exclude_flowery_language)

Composites are acyclic TERM expansion templates. $name substitutes the typed argument; fixed strings are semantic atoms. No silent defaults. Emit nested applications as separate TERM bindings; zero-argument calls are allowed only with a published decomposition. Bare legacy STRING use is deprecated. Jazz/classical piano topic labels do not express a separate genre/instrument relationship; decompose when needed. Named works/products are exact referents. Greatest-cricketer topic specifies neither a winner nor a greatness metric. Budget-limited supplies no monetary ceiling. constraint_17_plus retains its reviewed definition; use a numeric age requirement only when the source specifies age, not for an unspecified mature rating. event_* returns narrative TERM, not EVENT; char_* describes a character, not an asserted real person; chg_* describes intent; assert_* describes a test expectation, not success.

**rule_examples_general** (v19/rule/examples-general; rule governing example_a_select_two_pillows_and_move_those_objects)

Examples use this glossary's contracts. They have not been verified by an implemented BrainCode parser.

**rule_operations_general** (v19/rule/operations-general; rule governing walk)

Operations are callable vocabulary, not arbitrary values. Signatures and categories constrain each parameter; extra attributes need a reviewed profile. Bind REQUEST results. Failure creates no successful result; TRACE records failures without fabricated runtime values. Runtime failure handling is outside this profile. No automatic custom_general_<predicate> operation exists.

**rule_search_web_attributes** (v19/rule/search-web-attributes; rule governing search_web)

Optional filters: availability, category, color, cuisine, currency, gender, genre, location, platform, ram_unit, reservation_availability, shape, size (category-refined STRING); max_price, min_ram, min_rating (NUMBER); trending (BOOL). Explicit signature alternatives additionally admit atoms. Price requires currency; RAM requires a capacity unit; no default scale/source. rank is invalid: use sort, whose rank_field accepts rank_* and rank_direction accepts dir_*. Category/genre/availability accept only their own subfamilies.

**rule_supplemental_general** (v19/rule/supplemental-general; rule governing art_itinerary)

Supplementary entries obey the same static and RECORD rules. Aliases are empty unless explicitly stated; no undeclared domain vocabulary is implied.

**rule_support_primitives_general** (v19/rule/support-primitives-general; rule governing captioned_figure)

Pure TERM constructors assert nothing. Expansion literals are exact identifiers/atomic values, never hidden sentences. Omit unsupported optional arguments. Counts/indices are nonnegative integers; preserve.index ≥ 1; amounts are nonnegative. minimum_per_period.class uses semantic-category-value; period and temporal duration use the temporal duration-unit-value subset. activity verbs have the role-specific meanings defined in their composites; ambiguous new verbs need review and do not create executable operations.
